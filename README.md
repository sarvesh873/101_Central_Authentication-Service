🚀 Central Authentication Service

A lightweight, modular Authentication & User Management Service built using Spring Boot 3, OpenAPI 3, and PostgreSQL, following clean architecture and best coding practices.

This service provides user creation, user search, and future-ready JWT-based authentication (currently not enforced).
All controllers are auto-generated using OpenAPI Generator for consistent API design.
